CONTRIBUTIONS

TODO: write a brief summary of how each team member contributed to
the project.
Andy wrote the file memory mapping while Harry wrote the parallel sequencing. We work together on the README.

REPORT

TODO: add your report according to the instructions in the
"Experiments and analysis" section of the assignment description.

As the time decreases with the decreasing threshold, our results align with the expectation. 
This is because when the threshold is smaller, which means the merge-sort wonâ€™t enter seq-sort until a smaller threshold, more subsequent processes will be created. 
Therefore, we will make more effective use of the CPU, decreasing operating time.

In our case, multi-processing has increased the efficiency of the sorting, and increase the number of process in parallel will further
increase the efficiency. To start with, the mmap we used created a direct mapping betwwen memory and the file that can be shared between
processes, without requiring further copy or I/O, so increase process number won't have that much extra cost. In the program, tasks are 
finally divided in a way such that each sequential sort is runned in a separate process. As we are constantly using binary divison of array,
the data block that each process read from and write to is different, avoiding data dependency between them and allowing OS kernel to freely
schedule those processes in parallel on multiple CPU cores. Overall, the program divide the whole task into independent subtasks and separately
finish those task with multiple process, saving running time for the most tedious part of the whole task.
